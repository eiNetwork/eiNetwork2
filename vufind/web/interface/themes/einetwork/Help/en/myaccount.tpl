    <p>The Book Cart enables you to save items of interest while you continue to browse the library catalog.  
These items will remain in your book cart from session to session.  To save an item to your Book Cart, simply click the 
<span class="bold">Add to Cart</span> button found to the right of the item on the search results or the item detail page. If you have not already logged in to <span class="bold">My Account</span>, you will be prompted to enter your library card number and PIN.  Once you click Login, the item will be added to your cart.</p> 

    <p>To view items in your cart, click the <span class="bold">View Cart</span> button found in the upper right section of the page, below My Account.  From your cart, you can remove or request items you have added.  To request or remove a single item, choose <span class="bold">Request Now</span> or <span class="bold">Remove</span> from the menu to the right of the item.  It is also possible to request all of the items in your book cart at one time by choosing a pick up location in the drop down at the top of the page (if you have already indicated your <a href="#Preferred Libraries">preferred library</a> selection in your profile, this will be selected by default) and clicking <span class="bold">Request All</span>.</p> 
    
    <p>Please note that online content cannot be added to your Book Cart.</p>

    <ol>
    
      <li>Go to <span class="bold">Account Settings</span>, click <span class="bold">Edit Profile</span>, and make your Preferred and Alternative Library selections.</li>
      <li>When you are logged in to the online catalog, your Preferred Libraries selections are displayed in the right hand navigation panel beneath the banner that says “Keep Our Libraries Strong”.  From here you can click <span class="bold">Edit</span> and make selections for your Preferred Library and an Alternate Library.  The third choice for preferred libraries is set to your home library by default.
