        <p>The Book Cart enables you to save items of interest while you continue to browse the library catalog.  
    These items will remain in your book cart from session to session.  To save an item to your Book Cart, simply click the 
    <span class="bold">Add to Cart</span> button found to the right of the item on the search results or the item detail page. If you have not already logged in to <span class="bold">My Account</span>, you will be prompted to enter your library card number and PIN.  Once you click Login, the item will be added to your cart.</p> 

        <p>To view items in your cart, click the <span class="bold">View Cart</span> button found in the upper right section of the page, below My Account.  From your cart, you can remove or request items you have added.  To request or remove a single item, choose <span class="bold">Request Now</span> or <span class="bold">Remove</span> from the menu to the right of the item.  It is also possible to request all of the items in your book cart at one time by choosing a pick up location in the drop down at the top of the page (if you have already indicated your <a href="#Preferred Libraries">preferred library</a> selection in your profile, this will be selected by default) and clicking <span class="bold">Request All</span>.</p> 
        
        <p>Please note that online content cannot be added to your Book Cart.</p>

        <p>As a patron, you have the option to select two Preferred Libraries (in order of preference) where you would like to pick up your requested items.  When these choices are specified, your first choice becomes the default pickup location for your holds.  There are two ways to make these selections.  </p>

          <li>Go to <span class="bold">Account Settings</span>, click <span class="bold">Edit Profile</span>, and make your Preferred and Alternative Library selections.</li>
          <li>When you are logged in to the online catalog, your Preferred Libraries selections are displayed in the right hand navigation panel beneath the banner that says “Keep Our Libraries Strong”.  From here you can click <span class="bold">Edit</span> and make selections for your Preferred Library and an Alternate Library.  The third choice for preferred libraries is set to your home library by default.  After choosing your preferences from the drop down menus, click <span class="bold">Update Profile</span> to save your settings.</li>

        <p>Freezing requests offers a way to avoid having your requested items expire when you are out of town or otherwise unable to them up from the library.  If your request reaches the top of the queue while it is frozen, it will be skipped so that requests placed by other patrons can be filled.  When you reactivate your request, you will be placed at the front of the queue.</p> 
        <p>There are two situations in which a request cannot be frozen:</p>
        <ol class="help">
            <li>The hold is more than 255 days old.</li>
            <li>The hold is about the be filled (this means the item is either on the holdshelf or in transit to the holdshelf.</li>   
        </ol>
        <p>To freeze a request, navigate to your Requested Items page by clicking the link labeled "Update Requests" on the right hand navigation panel of the of the catalog.  If you have multiple requests, you can freeze all of them at once by clicking the Freeze All button that appears at the top and bottom of your requested items list.</p> 
        <p>To freeze only one request or a selection of requests, click the check box labeled Freeze next the item request you wish to freeze, then click the Update Selected button that appears at the top of the Requested Items page.</p>

        <p>If you owe more than $2.00, you can use a Visa, Master Card or Discover Card to pay fines and replacement fees online.</p>
        <p>When you log in to My account, you will receive a pop-up notification in the upper right hand corner letting you know that you owe fines.  The notice includes a button labeled “Pay Fine”.  Clicking that button redirects you to the Classic Catalog (the old library catalog) where will be asked to log in again before you can make a payment.</p>
