            Release date 4/22/2014
            <h3>Unfortunately due to some issues caused during our recent system upgrade, it was necessary to temporarily disable the new library catalog website. We continue to work on the underlying system issues and have made some temporary changes to allow us to re-enable the new catalog. These changes allow continued use of popular features in the new catalog, while we work to address the underlying problems. Below is a list of the changes we have made.</h3>
