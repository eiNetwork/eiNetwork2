            <h3>Unfortunately due to some issues caused during our recent system upgrade, it has been necessary to disable the new library catalog website.   We continue to work on the underlying system issues and have made some temporary changes to the new catalog.   These changes allow users to continue to use popular features in the new catalog, while we work to address the underlying problems . Below is a list of the visible changes we have made.</h3>
